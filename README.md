Object Oriented Programming Coursework

The high-level objective of this project is to develop an email client. To keep things simple, the client shall have only limited
functionality: logging in to a mail server (using the IMAP protocol), viewing emails and allowing their deletion.

The user interface is implemented as a terminal/console based application using the
```FinalCut``` library. The connection to the IMAP server is implemented using the ```libetpan``` library.

Look at the specification file for more details on how to run the program
